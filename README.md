- 👋 Hi, I’m Katon, and I'm new at github. I have studied statistics and work with data analysis since 2010. I can work with SQL, PowerBI and excel. But now I'm trying to improve my skills.

- 👀 I’m interested in data science, big data, dashboards, and everything about data.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning java and python. But I already know SQL.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that focus on data analysis of all kind.
- 📫 How to reach me: katonof@hotmail.com
